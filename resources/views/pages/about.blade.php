        <p> This website was developed by students of Informatics Engineering course at FEUP in the context of the
            Laboratório de Bases de Dados e Aplicações Web course unit. </p>
        <p> The goal of this project is to create an Online Auction website that allows users to sell any item they want
            and
            bid on the currently active auctions. </p>
        <p> Furthermore, we also have the reports functionality that is critical to make sure users don't try to
            sell/buy
            illegal items using our platform. </p>
